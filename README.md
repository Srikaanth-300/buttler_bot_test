# buttler_bot_test
This is a simulation of buttler robot using gazebo. URDF files were created with just a single laser sensor and the model was spawned in Gazebo with appropiate plugins for differential drive control.
Gmapping was used to map the environment. Navfn is the global planner and TrajectoryplannerROS is the local planner.
